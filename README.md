# question-paper-generator
In this system we present a smart question paper generating system for universities. It is made to allow universities to generate question papers with random but even questions to cover most chapters of subject with difficulty level within seconds and mail them to colleges instantly.  In our system we allow administrator to input a set of questions and respective answers for option ticking. We also allow admin to provide weight age and complexity for each of these questions. After this the questions are stored in database along with their weight age. Now on question paper generating time the admin just has to select the percentage of difficulty. On this selection the system selects questions randomly in a way that their weightage makes up for 100 marks and according to difficulty that admin chooses the questions are chosen based on their complexity level. The questions are also added for various difficulty levels so that as soon admin chooses the type of paper difficulty (Easy, medium, difficult) the system automatically generates paper, prepares doc file as per selected paper format. Also emails it to other colleges. After this q paper is converted to pdf file and emailed to colleges on button click.
